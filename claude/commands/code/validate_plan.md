# Validate Plan

You are tasked with validating that an implementation plan was correctly executed, verifying all success criteria and identifying any deviations or issues.

## Initial Setup

When invoked:
1. **Determine context** - Are you in an existing conversation or starting fresh?
   - If existing: Review what was implemented in this session
   - If fresh: Need to discover what was done through git and codebase analysis

2. **Locate the plan**:
   - If plan path provided, use it
   - Otherwise, search recent commits for plan references or ask user

3. **Gather implementation evidence**:
   ```bash
   # Check recent commits
   git log --oneline -n 20
   git diff HEAD~N..HEAD  # Where N covers implementation commits

   # Run comprehensive checks
   just lint
   just rebuild
   ```

## Validation Process

### Step 1: Context Discovery

If starting fresh or need more context:

1. **Read the implementation plan** completely
2. **Identify what should have changed**:
   - List all files that should be modified
   - Note all success criteria (automated and manual)
   - Identify key functionality to verify

3. **Spawn parallel research tasks** to discover implementation:
   ```
   Task 1 - Verify configuration changes:
   Research if the Nix modules/configs were added as specified.
   Check: module files, flake.nix imports, machine configs
   Return: What was implemented vs what plan specified

   Task 2 - Verify code changes:
   Find all modified files related to [feature].
   Compare actual changes to plan specifications.
   Return: File-by-file comparison of planned vs actual

   Task 3 - Verify test/lint coverage:
   Check if linting passes and configuration builds.
   Run verification commands and capture results.
   Return: Build/lint status and any issues
   ```

### Step 2: Systematic Validation

For each phase in the plan:

1. **Check completion status**:
   - Look for checkmarks in the plan (- [x])
   - Verify the actual code matches claimed completion

2. **Run automated verification**:
   - Execute each command from "Automated Verification"
   - Document pass/fail status
   - If failures, investigate root cause

3. **Assess manual criteria**:
   - List what needs manual testing
   - Provide clear steps for user verification

4. **Think deeply about edge cases**:
   - Were error conditions handled?
   - Are there missing validations?
   - Could the implementation break existing functionality?

### Step 3: Generate Validation Report

Create comprehensive validation summary:

```markdown
## Validation Report: [Plan Name]

### Implementation Status
✓ Phase 1: [Name] - Fully implemented
✓ Phase 2: [Name] - Fully implemented
⚠️ Phase 3: [Name] - Partially implemented (see issues)

### Automated Verification Results
✓ Build passes: `just rebuild`
✓ Lint passes: `just lint`
✗ Flake check: `nix flake check` (1 failure)

### Code Review Findings

#### Matches Plan:
- Module correctly added to flake.nix
- Home-manager config follows existing patterns
- Machine-specific settings applied correctly

#### Deviations from Plan:
- Used different option name in [file:line]
- Added extra configuration in [file:line] (improvement)

#### Potential Issues:
- Missing conditional for Linux compatibility
- No fallback for missing package on stable channel

### Manual Testing Required:
1. System behavior:
   - [ ] Verify [feature] works after `drs`
   - [ ] Test shell behavior with new configuration

2. Integration:
   - [ ] Confirm works with existing [component]
   - [ ] Check no regressions in related features

### Recommendations:
- Address flake check failure before merging
- Consider adding conditional for Linux support
- Document new configuration options
```

## Working with Existing Context

If you were part of the implementation:
- Review the conversation history
- Check your todo list for what was completed
- Focus validation on work done in this session
- Be honest about any shortcuts or incomplete items

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be thorough but practical** - Focus on what matters
2. **Run all automated checks** - Don't skip verification commands
3. **Document everything** - Both successes and issues
4. **Think critically** - Question if the implementation truly solves the problem
5. **Consider maintenance** - Will this be maintainable long-term?

## Validation Checklist

Always verify:
- [ ] All phases marked complete are actually done
- [ ] Automated checks pass (`just lint`, `just rebuild`)
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Manual test steps are clear

## Relationship to Other Commands

Recommended workflow:
1. `/implement_plan` - Execute the implementation
2. `/commit` - Create atomic commits for changes
3. `/validate_plan` - Verify implementation correctness
4. `/commit-push-pr` - Push and create PR

The validation works best after commits are made, as it can analyze the git history to understand what was implemented.

Remember: Good validation catches issues before they reach production. Be constructive but thorough in identifying gaps or improvements.
